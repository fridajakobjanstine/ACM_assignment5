### Thoughts on computational cognitive modeling and what we learned
A general takeaway is that we are developing a habit of critically reflecting on every step of building a model, including data preprocessing. 
This counts not only for cognitive models, but for model building in general. 
When building Bayesian models, we are to a much higher extend concerned with extracting all information there is to be found in the data. While classical statistics are not always complex enough to also do this, it may still benefit from the same careful considerations of whether we are actually taking advantage of what we know. 

We have been used to thinking about assumptions as in the first semester kind of way, where it is tied to the data and concerns homoscedasticity etc. 
However, in cognitive modeling we are also thinking about assumptions in the sense that we make assumptions of how the human mind works and which theories we believe are plausible and implausible. It is a more subtle and implicit set of assumptions because of the flexibility of Bayesian modeling, but in a way they are more important as they relate to what we can say with our results. 

In terms of what we will use cognitive modeling for in the future, we are not very sure. It seems like a powerful tool that can do complex things, but on the same time it also seems a little niche, only in used in dedicated research groups or a few selected private companies. Either computational cognitive modeling using STAN is the only thing we'll be doing in our future careers or we will never touch it again. 

### Thoughts on the course and portfolios
We realise that structuring the course content and the portfolios are not very easy. However, we feel like it has been very much an advanced Bayesian modelling/STAN course and not so much _cognitive_ modeling. We have only talked about a few models of cognition (WSLS in matching pennies, RL) and mainly looked at them in a the most simple, single agent case. Clearly, this is necesary to have the time to really understand the STAN code and get closer to really grasping what it is that we are modeling and assuming - which we think is great, we really enjoyed actually getting into the machinery of cognitive modelling. Seeing the sample-simulator at the last lecture was a very different experience (in a good way) from the first time we saw it on the bachelor's. But it also pulls some focus away from the cognitive processes. In decision making, one the greatest lectures was when Simon (who works at Mindway AI) came and told us about his work on cognitive modeling in gaming. Something like that to tie what we learn to how it can be used in more complex settings would have been very interesting.
